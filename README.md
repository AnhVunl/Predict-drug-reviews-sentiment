In total, I conducted three different experiments, to achieve these two objectives:

1. Conduct sentiment analysis of drug reviews
2. Measure relatedness between text features and review ratings

The dataset could be found at this URL:

The pre-processed CSV file can be extracted by running the script /pre-processing/feature_extraction_all, then please proceed with the scripts in the experiment folder
