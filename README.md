# Sentiment Analysis on drug reviews

We conducted this analysis on a total of 213,869 drug reviews, compiled by Felix Gräßer, Surya Kallumadi, Hagen Malberg, and Sebastian Zaunseder in December, 2018.
The goal is to distinguish positive from negative drug reviews using fine-grained feature engineering methodologies (polarized POS tags, negations and syntactic dependencies).

We recommend you to first run the script /pre-processing/feature_extraction_all in the pre-processing directory. 
After that, use the CSV file that is extracted as input for the models in the experiment_1 folder.
